# 06-3D-RPG
Project 06 for the SP21 section of BL-MSCH-C220. 1 May 2021.

3D RPG featuring a mustachio'd main character on his journey to hit five randomly placed targets in the middle of a campground...with a blaster gun?! Surely there's some archery code that he missed out on, but the groundskeeper (however fond of tutorials they might be) doesn't seem to care a whit.
